    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! Iâ€™m Nikita, an aspiring IT professional passionate about technology and software development. After exploring different career paths, I realized that IT offers endless opportunities to learn, create, and solve real-world problems. This is why I decided to switch to IT and invest my time in building a strong foundation in web development.

I bring a strong work ethic, curiosity, and a problem-solving mindset to every project I undertake. I enjoy collaborating with others, learning new skills, and challenging myself to improve continuously. My strengths include adaptability, attention to detail, and effective communication.

In the future, I aim to contribute to innovative projects that make a difference and grow as a developer who can build efficient, user-friendly, and impactful software.
